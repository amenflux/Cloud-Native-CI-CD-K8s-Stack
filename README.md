# WordPress CloudNative Stack - Production DevOps Platform

## Project Overview

This project was originally created for one of the firms I worked for as a comprehensive solution to enable non-technical team members to configure, monitor, and adjust CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes deployments without needing deep command-line knowledge. The goal was to democratize DevOps operations through an intuitive web interface.

**Important Note**: This project does not have a real backend since it's purely for demonstration purposes. I didn't want to incur cloud service costs just for showcasing the solution. However, the frontend is fully configured to demonstrate what the complete solution would look like in a production environment. I've adjusted the original internal tool to remove any confidential information while maintaining all the educational and functional aspects.

While this is a demonstration, the configurations and templates provided can be used by anyone to automate real-world WordPress deployments with MySQL, MongoDB, and advanced DevOps workflows.

## How Security Data Collection Works

### Real-World Implementation Details

In a production environment, the security monitoring system would collect data through multiple channels:

#### 1. **Kubernetes Audit Logs**
```bash
# Enable audit logging in kube-apiserver
--audit-log-path=/var/log/kubernetes/audit.log
--audit-policy-file=/etc/kubernetes/audit-policy.yaml
```
- API server interactions are logged and analyzed for suspicious patterns
- Failed authentication attempts are tracked and correlated
- Resource access violations are flagged and reported

#### 2. **Application-Level Monitoring**
```javascript
// WordPress security plugin integration
const securityEvents = {
  failedLogins: 'wp_login_failed',
  suspiciousActivity: 'wp_security_alert',
  fileChanges: 'wp_file_monitor'
};
```
- WordPress security plugins (like Wordfence) expose security events via APIs
- Custom middleware captures and forwards security events to monitoring systems
- Database queries are monitored for SQL injection attempts

#### 3. **Network-Level Security**
```yaml
# Network policies for traffic monitoring
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: wordpress-security-monitoring
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: wordpress
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```
- Istio service mesh or similar tools provide traffic analytics
- Ingress controllers log all HTTP requests with detailed headers
- Network policies monitor and restrict pod-to-pod communication

#### 4. **Log Aggregation Pipeline**
```yaml
# Fluent Bit configuration for log collection
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: fluent-bit-config
data:
  fluent-bit.conf: |
    [INPUT]
        Name tail
        Path /var/log/containers/*wordpress*.log
        Parser kubernetes
    [OUTPUT]
        Name es
        Match *
        Host elasticsearch.monitoring.svc.cluster.local
```
- Fluent Bit or Fluentd agents collect logs from all WordPress containers
- Elasticsearch aggregates and indexes security events
- Kibana provides visualization and alerting on security patterns

#### 5. **Prometheus Metrics Collection**
```yaml
# Custom security metrics
wordpress_failed_logins_total{pod="wordpress-xxx", namespace="production"}
wordpress_suspicious_requests_total{type="sql_injection", severity="high"}
```
- Custom metrics exporters track security-specific events
- Prometheus scrapes metrics from WordPress applications
- AlertManager triggers notifications based on security thresholds

### Data Flow Architecture

1. **Event Generation** - WordPress, Kubernetes, and network layers generate security events
2. **Log Collection** - Fluent Bit agents collect and forward logs to central storage
3. **Data Processing** - Logstash or similar tools parse and enrich security data
4. **Storage** - Elasticsearch stores processed security events with full-text search
5. **Visualization** - Custom React components query Elasticsearch via REST APIs
6. **Alerting** - Automated alerts trigger based on predefined security patterns

## Customization Guide

### 1. **Branding and Styling**
```typescript
// Update in tailwind.config.ts
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: "your-brand-color",
      secondary: "your-accent-color"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Infrastructure Configuration**
Replace placeholder values in configuration templates:
- `${GIT_REPOSITORY_URL}` - Your Git repository URL
- `${CONTAINER_REGISTRY}` - Your Docker registry (ECR, GCR, Docker Hub)
- `${APPLICATION_NAMESPACE}` - Your preferred Kubernetes namespace
- `${APP_HOSTNAME}` - Your domain name for ingress configuration

### 3. **Database Configuration**
```yaml
# MySQL Configuration (RDS or self-hosted)
mysql:
  host: "your-mysql-endpoint"
  database: "wordpress_production"
  user: "wp_admin"

# MongoDB Configuration (DocumentDB or self-hosted)
mongodb:
  connectionString: "mongodb://your-mongodb-cluster"
  database: "wordpress_analytics"
```

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline Customization**
Update Jenkins pipeline templates with your specific:
- Build commands and test suites
- Docker registry push configurations
- Deployment approval processes
- Notification channels (Slack, email, Teams)

## Real-World Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster (EKS, GKE, AKS, or self-managed)
- kubectl configured with cluster access
- Helm 3.x installed
- Docker registry access
- Domain name for ingress (optional)

### Production Deployment Steps

1. **Cluster Preparation**
```bash
# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace wordpress-production

# Install ingress controller
helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx

# Install cert-manager for SSL
helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager --set installCRDs=true
```

2. **Database Setup**
```bash
# Deploy MySQL with persistent storage
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/mysql-deployment.yaml

# Deploy MongoDB for analytics
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/mongodb-deployment.yaml

# Verify database connectivity
kubectl exec -it mysql-pod -- mysql -u root -p
```

3. **WordPress Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy WordPress application
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/wordpress-deployment.yaml

# Configure horizontal pod autoscaler
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/wordpress-hpa.yaml

# Set up ingress with SSL
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/wordpress-ingress.yaml
```

4. **Monitoring Setup**
```bash
# Install Prometheus stack
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack

# Deploy custom WordPress metrics exporter
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/wordpress-metrics.yaml
```

### Environment-Specific Configurations

#### Staging Environment
- Single replica WordPress pods
- Shared database instances
- Basic monitoring without alerting
- HTTP-only ingress (no SSL requirement)

#### Production Environment
- Multiple WordPress replicas with anti-affinity
- Dedicated database instances with backup
- Comprehensive monitoring with alerting
- SSL-enabled ingress with rate limiting

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- **Application Metrics** - WordPress response times, database queries, user sessions
- **Infrastructure Metrics** - CPU, memory, disk, network utilization
- **Business Metrics** - User registrations, content creation, revenue tracking
- **Security Metrics** - Failed logins, suspicious activities, vulnerability scans

### Alerting Rules
```yaml
# Critical alerts
- alert: WordPressDown
  expr: up{job="wordpress"} == 0
  for: 2m
  labels:
    severity: critical
  annotations:
    summary: "WordPress is down"

- alert: DatabaseConnectionFailure
  expr: mysql_up{job="mysql"} == 0
  for: 1m
  labels:
    severity: critical
```
